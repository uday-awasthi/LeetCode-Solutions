QUES - 509. Fibonacci Number

The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.
Given n, calculate F(n).


## SOLUTION 

class Solution:
    def fib(self, n: int) -> int:
        a, b = 0, 1

        for _ in range(n):
            a, b = b, a + b

        return a
