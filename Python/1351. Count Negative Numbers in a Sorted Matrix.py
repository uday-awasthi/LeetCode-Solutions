1351. Count Negative Numbers in a Sorted Matrix
Given a m x n matrix grid which is sorted in non-increasing order both row-wise and column-wise, return the number of negative numbers in grid.

Example 1:

Input: grid = [[4,3,2,-1],[3,2,1,-1],[1,1,-1,-2],[-1,-1,-2,-3]]
Output: 8
Explanation: There are 8 negatives number in the matrix.
Example 2:

Input: grid = [[3,2],[1,0]]
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 100
-100 <= grid[i][j] <= 100
 

Follow up: Could you find an O(n + m) solution?














## SOLUTION 

class Solution:
    def countNegatives(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        
        row = 0
        col = n - 1
        count = 0
        
        while row < m and col >= 0:
            if grid[row][col] < 0:
                # all elements below in this column are negative
                count += (m - row)
                col -= 1
            else:
                row += 1
        
        return count
